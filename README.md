# My interactive resume
This is a client side web page I have created to serve as an interactive resume. I created it for the sake of my job seeking as a WEB/Frontend developer.
This resume is hosted on Github pages and is accesible on http://simohamzaoui.info

## Getting Started

This is a client side project. You do not need to install anything. Just download or clone this repository and open index.html.
In order for this project to be able to be hosted on Github pages, the content static instead of dynamic.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)


## License

This code is free to use, no credit needed.
